Hey all, I'm @rob-forager, the CTO for [Forager Technologies](https://foragersoftware.com). We're hitting the AgTech space, building applications to help
farmers manage and scale their business.

I've got about 15 years of software engineering experience, both in tiny startups and in large tech companies. Most of my technical experience has been in
building large-scale data and AI systems, using languages like C++, Go, and Python.

More recently my energy has gone into building up the foundations
of engineering teams: hiring people, designing software processes, and figuring out how to build a company that can consistently produce good quality
software.

I'm always happy to chat with people who want to work together; my email is [rob@foragersoftware.com](mailto:rob@foragersoftware.com).
